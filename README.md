## Tomb Annihilation Travelogue

Generates travel days for the ToA campaign, with some additional rules from
[Kyle Maxwell](https://skaldforge.wordpress.com/2017/10/02/tomb-of-annihilation-hex-crawl-procedure/).

I did this because I'm about to run ToA, and didn't want to bother with rolling
as my group went. Also, I wanted to try [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io).

### Getting Started

```bash
$ yarn
$ yarn dev
```

### Building

```bash
$ yarn build
```

### Todo

* [x] Redo styles to be mobile-first
* [x] Remove react dependenedent library (feather icons)
* [x] Get a favicon
* [ ] Implement proper analytics module
